        <p>
          I'm a software engineer building tools for the web with researchers
          and developers at Northwestern, Adobe, and the University of Maryland.
          In my spare time, I like to research programming languages. I love
          building systems for other people to use; I enjoy untangling dirty
          code and messy systems. Cleaning up technical debt may not seem
          glamarous, but I want to make the world more maintainable one program
          at a time.
        </p>

          Before becoming a developer, I wanted to work as a high-school English
          teacher. I enjoy skiing, bookstores, swimming, cozy fireplaces, and
          the occasional game of Magic: The Gathering with friends.
