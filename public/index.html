        <p>
          I'm a graduate student at Northwestern University studying programming
          languages. Right now, I'm working on making JavaScript and TypeScript
          more pleasant to write. Challenges working with those languages at
          scale abound; I'm interested in making the web a simpler place.

          I enjoy untangling dirty code and messy systems. Cleaning up technical
          debt may not seem glamarous, but I enjoy making the world more
          maintainable one program at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also adore LISP and want some dialect of the language to spread. If
          you're interested in learning more, consider starting with
          <a class="link" href="https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a>. I want as
          many people as possible to discover the joy of building programs by
          writing down the syntax tree that represents them directly.

          Before becoming a developer, I wanted to work as a high-school English
          teacher. I'm a big fan of Russian literature, English education, and
          musical theatre.
