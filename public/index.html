            My name is Josh. I'm an engineer building websites to improve AI
            systems with teammates at Adobe, Northwestern, and the University of
            Maryland. In my spare time, I also research programming langauges.
            My work there involves applying contract systems to detect bugs in
            TypeScript type declarations.
          </p>
          <p class="about-par">
            I love building tools that make other people more effective at what
            they do. For that reason, I enjoy building user interfaces,
            infrastructure, and development tools. There's nothing quite so
            rewarding to me as helping other people move faster.
          </p>
