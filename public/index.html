          I'm a graduate student at Northwestern University studying programming
          languages. Right now, I'm working on making JavaScript and TypeScript
          more pleasant to write. Challenges building software with those
          languages at scale abound, and I'm interested in making the web a
          simpler place.

          My favorite language is
          <a class="link" href="https://racket-lang.org">Racket</a>. All
          dialects of LISP make me happy; I want as many people as possible to
          discover the joy of building programs by writing down the syntax tree
          that represents them directly. If you're interested in learning more,
          consider reading
          <a class="link" href="https://htdp.org">How to Design Programs</a>,
          which is a fantastic introduction to both programming and computer
          science.

          I enjoy untangling dirty code and messy systems. Cleaning up technical
          debt may not seem glamarous, but I enjoy making the world more
          maintainable one program at a time.

          Before becoming a developer, I wanted to work as a high-school English
          teacher. I'm a big fan of Russian literature, English education, and
          musical theatre.
