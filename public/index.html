          I'm a graduate student at Northwestern University studying programming
          languages. Right now, I'm working on making JavaScript and TypeScript
          more pleasant to write. Challenges working with those languages at
          scale abound, and I'm interested in making the web a simpler place.

          My favorite language is LISP, and I want some dialect of it to spread.
          I want as many people as possible to discover the joy of building
          programs by writing down the syntax tree that represents them
          directly. If you're interested in learning more, consider picking up

          I enjoy untangling dirty code and messy systems. Cleaning up technical
          debt may not seem glamarous, but I enjoy making the world more
          maintainable one program at a time.

          Before becoming a developer, I wanted to work as a high-school English
          teacher. I'm a big fan of Russian literature, English education, and
          musical theatre.
